## The Optimization Problem

### What is Optimization in Machine Learning?

**Core Problem:** Find the best parameters θ for your model that minimize the loss function J(θ).

Think of it as finding the lowest point in a complex mountain landscape while blindfolded - you can only feel the slope under your feet (the gradient).

### Why Traditional Methods Failed

**The Scale Problem:**
- Neural networks: millions/billions of parameters
- Datasets: millions/billions of examples
- Computing exact gradients over entire datasets = computationally impossible

**Non-convex Landscapes:**
- Unlike smooth mathematical functions, neural network loss surfaces are full of:
  - Local minima
  - Saddle points  
  - Plateaus
  - Sharp valleys

### The Breakthrough Insight

> **Key Insight:** We don't need perfect gradients. We can estimate them using small random subsets (mini-batches) and still converge to good solutions.

This trade-off between computational efficiency and gradient accuracy opened the door to modern deep learning.

## Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)

### The Math

$$\theta_{t+1} = \theta_t - \eta \nabla_\theta J(\theta_t)$$

Where:
- θ = parameters
- η = learning rate  
- ∇J = gradient

### The Revolutionary Insight

Instead of computing gradients on the entire dataset (expensive), compute them on small batches.

**Why this works:** The gradient from a single example is an **unbiased estimator** of the true gradient.

$$\mathbb{E}[\nabla_\theta J_i(\theta)] = \nabla_\theta J(\theta)$$

### Mini-batch SGD

In practice, we use mini-batches (32-256 examples) instead of single examples:

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Better gradient estimates (less noise)
- ✅ Computational efficiency (vectorization) 
- ✅ Memory constraints (fits in GPU memory)
- ✅ Regularization effect (noise helps escape bad minima)

### SGD Limitations

| Problem | Description | Impact |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Learning Rate Sensitivity** | Too high → overshoot; too low → slow | Requires careful tuning |
| **Uniform Treatment** | Same LR for all parameters | Inefficient for sparse features |
| **Oscillations** | Zigzags in narrow valleys | Slow convergence |
| **Plateau Sensitivity** | Gets stuck where gradients are small | Training stalls |

> **Note:** These limitations motivated decades of research into better optimization methods.

## SGD with Momentum

### The Physical Intuition

Think of a ball rolling down a hill:
- Accumulates velocity over time
- Coasts through flat regions
- Dampens oscillations

### The Math

$$v_t = \beta v_{t-1} + \eta \nabla_\theta J(\theta_t)$$
$$\theta_{t+1} = \theta_t - v_t$$

**Typical values:** β = 0.9

### Why Momentum Works

Momentum implements an **exponential moving average** of gradients:

1. **Acceleration in consistent directions:** When gradients consistently point the same way, momentum accumulates
2. **Dampening oscillations:** When gradients oscillate, momentum smooths them out
3. **Carrying through plateaus:** Accumulated velocity helps cross flat regions

### Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG)

**The "look-ahead" improvement:**

$$v_t = \beta v_{t-1} + \eta \nabla_\theta J(\theta_t - \beta v_{t-1})$$
$$\theta_{t+1} = \theta_t - v_t$$

**Key difference:** Evaluate gradient at the anticipated future position, not current position.

### Momentum: Pros & Cons

**✅ Pros:**
- Faster convergence than SGD
- Dampens oscillations
- Carries through plateaus
- Generally better than vanilla SGD

**❌ Cons:**
- Still sensitive to learning rate
- One more hyperparameter (β)
- Same LR for all parameters
- May overshoot minima

## AdaGrad: First Adaptive Method

### The Revolutionary Idea

**Adaptive learning rates:** Different learning rates for different parameters based on their historical gradient information.

### The Math

$$G_t = G_{t-1} + \nabla_\theta J(\theta_t)^2$$
$$\theta_{t+1} = \theta_t - \frac{\eta}{\sqrt{G_t + \epsilon}} \nabla_\theta J(\theta_t)$$

Where:
- $G_t$ accumulates squared gradients element-wise
- ε ≈ 1e-8 (prevents division by zero)

### Why AdaGrad Works

**The Logic:**
- Parameters with **large historical gradients** → smaller effective learning rates → prevent overshooting
- Parameters with **small historical gradients** → larger effective learning rates → faster learning

**Perfect for sparse data:**
- In NLP: common words ("the", "and") appear frequently → large gradients → smaller LR
- Rare words appear infrequently → small gradients → larger effective LR when they do appear

### The Fatal Flaw

> **Problem:** $G_t$ only grows, never shrinks. Eventually, all learning rates approach zero and learning stops completely.

$$\lim_{t \to \infty} \frac{\eta}{\sqrt{G_t + \epsilon}} = 0$$

This makes AdaGrad unsuitable for long training runs.

---

## RMSProp: Fixing AdaGrad

### The Fix

Use **exponential moving average** instead of accumulating all gradients forever.

### The Math

$$G_t = \beta G_{t-1} + (1-\beta) \nabla_\theta J(\theta_t)^2$$
$$\theta_{t+1} = \theta_t - \frac{\eta}{\sqrt{G_t + \epsilon}} \nabla_\theta J(\theta_t)$$

**Typical values:** β = 0.9

### Why Exponential Moving Average Works

Creates a "sliding window" of gradient history:
- **Recent gradients** have more influence
- **Old gradients** gradually fade away  
- **Prevents learning rate decay** to zero
- **Adapts to changing patterns** during training

### Historical Note

> **Fun fact:** RMSProp became popular through Geoffrey Hinton's Coursera course, not academic papers. This shows the importance of practical validation in optimization methods.

### RMSProp Limitation

Still missing momentum - makes greedy, instantaneous decisions without the smoothing benefits of momentum.

## Adam: The King of Optimizers

### The Best of Both Worlds

Adam combines:
- **Momentum** (first moment estimation)
- **Adaptive learning rates** (second moment estimation)
- **Bias correction** for early training steps

### The Math

$$m_t = \beta_1 m_{t-1} + (1-\beta_1) \nabla_\theta J(\theta_t) \quad \text{(momentum)}$$

$$v_t = \beta_2 v_{t-1} + (1-\beta_2) \nabla_\theta J(\theta_t)^2 \quad \text{(RMSProp)}$$

$$\hat{m}_t = \frac{m_t}{1-\beta_1^t}, \quad \hat{v}_t = \frac{v_t}{1-\beta_2^t} \quad \text{(bias correction)}$$

$$\theta_{t+1} = \theta_t - \frac{\eta}{\sqrt{\hat{v}_t} + \epsilon} \hat{m}_t$$

### Default Hyperparameters

| Parameter | Default Value | Purpose |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| β₁ | 0.9 | Momentum decay |
| β₂ | 0.999 | Second moment decay |
| η | 0.001 | Learning rate |
| ε | 1e-8 | Numerical stability |

> **Why these work:** These values are robust across a wide range of problems, making Adam a reliable "default" optimizer.

### The Bias Correction Insight

**Without bias correction:**
- Early iterations have very small steps
- $m_t$ and $v_t$ are biased toward zero (initialized as zero)

**With bias correction:**
- Correction factors $(1-\beta_1^t)$ and $(1-\beta_2^t)$ ensure appropriate step sizes from the beginning
- Especially important in early training

### Why Adam Became Dominant

**✅ Advantages:**
- Works well "out of the box"
- Combines momentum + adaptive learning rates
- Robust across many different problems
- Fast convergence
- Minimal hyperparameter tuning required

**❌ Disadvantages:**
- May not converge to optimal solution in some cases
- Memory overhead (stores both $m_t$ and $v_t$)
- Can be outperformed by SGD on some computer vision tasks

## AdamW: Better Weight Decay

### The Problem with Adam's Weight Decay

**Standard Adam with L2 regularization:**
$$\theta_{t+1} = \theta_t - \frac{\eta}{\sqrt{\hat{v}_t} + \epsilon} (\hat{m}_t + \lambda \theta_t)$$

**Problem:** Weight decay gets scaled by adaptive learning rates, leading to inconsistent regularization.

### AdamW's Solution: Decoupled Weight Decay

$$\theta_{t+1} = \theta_t - \frac{\eta}{\sqrt{\hat{v}_t} + \epsilon} \hat{m}_t - \eta \lambda \theta_t$$

**Key difference:** Separate weight decay term $\eta \lambda \theta_t$ that applies uniform regularization.

### Why This Matters

- **Consistent regularization** regardless of adaptive learning rate scaling
- **Better generalization** especially for large models
- **Crucial for training large language models** (GPT, BERT, etc.)

> **Impact:** AdamW is the optimizer behind most state-of-the-art language models.

## Learning Rate Scheduling

### Why Constant Learning Rates Aren't Optimal

**The intuition:** 
- **Early training:** Large steps to quickly reach good regions
- **Later training:** Smaller steps for fine-tuning and stability

### Common Schedules

#### 1. Step Decay
$$\eta_t = \eta_0 \times \gamma^{\lfloor t/s \rfloor}$$

**Use case:** Simple, predetermined drops at specific epochs

#### 2. Exponential Decay
$$\eta_t = \eta_0 \times \gamma^t$$

**Use case:** Smooth continuous decay

#### 3. Cosine Annealing
$$\eta_t = \eta_{min} + (\eta_{max} - \eta_{min}) \times \frac{1 + \cos(\pi t/T)}{2}$$

**Use case:** Modern default for many tasks

#### 4. Warmup + Cosine
- **Warmup phase:** Linear increase from 0 to target LR
- **Main phase:** Cosine annealing from target to minimum

**Use case:** Large models, large batch sizes

### Warmup: The Gentle Start

**Why warmup helps:**
- At initialization, parameters are random
- Gradients can be very large or very small
- Gradually increasing LR gives optimizer time to find good initial directions
- Essential for large models and large batch training

**Typical warmup:** 1-10% of total training steps

### When to Use What

**🏆 AdamW (Default Choice):**
- New projects
- NLP/Transformers  
- When you want something that "just works"

**🎯 SGD + Momentum:**
- Computer vision (CNNs)
- When final accuracy matters more than training speed
- Limited memory/compute
- When you have time to tune hyperparameters

**⚡ RMSProp:**
- RNNs/LSTMs
- Older architectures
- When Adam seems unstable

### The Meta-Lesson

> **Optimization in ML is both science and art.** Theoretical guarantees are nice, but empirical performance on real problems is what matters. The "best" optimizer depends on your specific problem, architecture, and data.

### Final Practical Wisdom

1. **Start simple:** Get SGD working first, then try adaptive methods
2. **Learning rate first:** Tune LR before switching optimizers  
3. **Monitor training curves:** They tell you more than final metrics
4. **Use schedules:** Almost always helps, especially warmup for large models
5. **Don't overthink:** Adam/AdamW with defaults works for 80% of cases
